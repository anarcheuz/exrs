House of spirit concept 32 bits - Poc might see day if I have some time
Goal: force malloc to give an arbitrary address by forcing that adress in a fastbin
condition:  the targeted call to malloc must have size N <= 64 (max_fastbin)
            be able to pass arbitrary ptr to free() and control 2 words aroud that zone :

word1 (size = N+8)
... <- ptr points to zone just after the word1 size
target
...
word2 ( 8 < size < av->system)

word1 and word2 must be apart of exactly N+8 bytes.

Next call to malloc will return the ptr passed to free.
